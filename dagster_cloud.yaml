# See: https://docs.dagster.io/deployment/guides/dagster-cloud/deploying-code-locations for full documentation
#
# This file configures Dagster code locations for deployment (e.g., Dagster Cloud).
#
# ---
# Template note:
# - You can rename code locations and packages as needed.
# - For a multi-repo setup, you can point to remote Python packages or Docker images (see below).
#
# Example for a remote code location (multi-repo):
#
# locations:
#   - location_name: etl
#     code_source:
#       package_name: my_etl
#       # Or use a Docker image:
#       # image: myorg/my-etl:latest
#
locations:
  - location_name: 1-etl
    build:
      directory: 1_etl_code_location
    code_source:
      package_name: 1_etl
  - location_name: 2-model
    build:
      directory: 2_model_code_location
    code_source:
      package_name: 2_model
  - location_name: 3-evaluate
    build:
      directory: 3_evaluate_code_location
    code_source:
      package_name: 3_evaluate
  - location_name: 4-deploy
    build:
      directory: 4_deploy_code_location
    code_source:
      package_name: 4_deploy

# Dagster workspace.yaml
# See: https://docs.dagster.io/concepts/code-locations/workspaces for full documentation
#
# This file configures how Dagster loads code locations for local development.
#
# ---
# Template note:
# - You can rename code locations and packages as needed.
# - For a multi-repo setup, you can point to remote Python packages or Docker images (see below).
#
# Example for a remote code location (multi-repo):
#
# load_from:
#   - python_package:
#       package_name: my_etl
#       location_name: etl
#       executable_path: /path/to/remote/venv/bin/python
#   - grpc_server:
#       host: my-etl-service.company.com
#       port: 4000
#
# Or use a Docker image:
#   - python_package:
#       package_name: my_etl
#       location_name: etl
#       image: myorg/my-etl:latest
#
load_from:
  - python_package:
      package_name: 1_etl
      location_name: 1_etl
      working_directory: 1_etl_code_location
      executable_path: ./1_etl_code_location/.venv/bin/python

  - python_package:
      package_name: 2_model
      location_name: 2_model
      working_directory: 2_model_code_location
      executable_path: ./2_model_code_location/.venv/bin/python

  - python_package:
      package_name: 3_evaluate
      location_name: 3_evaluate
      working_directory: 3_evaluate_code_location
      executable_path: ./3_evaluate_code_location/.venv/bin/python

  - python_package:
      package_name: 4_deploy
      location_name: 4_deploy
      working_directory: 4_deploy_code_location
      executable_path: ./4_deploy_code_location/.venv/bin/python
